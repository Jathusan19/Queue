# Deque Project

This repository contains a Java implementation of a Deque (Double-Ended Queue) data structure. The project includes the necessary classes and a main class to demonstrate its functionality.

## Files in the Repository

- `Deque.java`: Contains the implementation of the Deque data structure.
- `Main.java`: Contains the `main` method to run and test the Deque implementation.
- `Deque.class`: Compiled bytecode for the Deque class.
- `Main.class`: Compiled bytecode for the Main class.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## How to Compile and Run ##


1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Compile the Java source files:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Java files:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/files
   ```

   Then, compile the source files:

   ```sh
   javac Deque.java Main.java
   ```

3. **Run the compiled Java application:**

   ```sh
   java Main
   ```

## Deque Class

The `Deque` class provides the following functionalities:

- `addFirst()`: Adds an element to the front of the deque.
- `addLast()`: Adds an element to the end of the deque.
- `removeFirst()`: Removes and returns the first element of the deque.
- `removeLast()`: Removes and returns the last element of the deque.
- `peekFirst()`: Returns the first element without removing it.
- `peekLast()`: Returns the last element without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the deque is empty.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the deque.

## Main Class

The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the `Deque` class. It contains the `main` method which creates an instance of `Deque` and performs various operations to showcase its functionality.
